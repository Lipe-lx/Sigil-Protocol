# Sigil Protocol ⚡

**The Certificate Authority for AI Skills**

Sigil Protocol transforms AI skills (`SKILL.md`) into verifiable, audited, and monetizable assets on the Solana blockchain. Using the x402 protocol, it enables atomic USDC payments and reputation-based discovery.

## Features
- **Verifiable Registry**: On-chain proof of skill ownership and audit history.
- **Sigil Chain**: A cryptographic chain of auditor signatures for each skill.
- **x402 Monetization**: Automated per-execution billing in USDC.
- **Reputation System**: Trust scores based on audits, successful executions, and recency.

## Tech Stack
- **Solana**: Anchor Framework (v0.32.1), Agave (v3.0.x)
- **Payments**: x402 V2, SPL Token (USDC)
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express, Apollo GraphQL
- **Frontend**: Next.js 15, React 19, Tailwind CSS
