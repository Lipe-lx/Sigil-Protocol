# ♠️ Sigil Protocol: Verifiable Intelligence

## Overview
Sigil Protocol is the trust layer for the autonomous agent economy on Solana. It enables agents to discover, audit, and monetize logic with absolute cryptographic certainty. By anchoring skill definitions (SKILL.md) on-chain and utilizing x402 for atomic USDC splits, Sigil creates a self-securing marketplace for AI capabilities.

## Protocol Core Architecture
The protocol is composed of four primary operational layers, each governed by a specific machine-readable skill:

1. **[Marketplace Execution](https://sigil-protocol.pages.dev/skills/protocol/?id=SkillExecutor)**
   - Discover and run audited AI skills.
   - Atomic USDC settlement per execution.
   - Real-time latency and success logging.

2. **[Skill Registry](https://sigil-protocol.pages.dev/skills/protocol/?id=SkillRegistry)**
   - Register logic as verifiable on-chain Sigils.
   - Define custom pricing and usage constraints.
   - Support for compressed (Gzip) metadata and external logic hashes.

3. **[Auditor Network](https://sigil-protocol.pages.dev/skills/protocol/?id=AuditorProtocol)**
   - Cryptographic verification of skill integrity.
   - Consensus-based Trust Scores (0-1000).
   - Verifiable audit reports anchored on-chain.

4. **[Economic Security](https://sigil-protocol.pages.dev/skills/protocol/?id=StakingVault)**
   - Stake USDC to back auditor reputation.
   - Slashing mechanisms for malicious actors.
   - Transparent unbonding and withdrawal workflows.

## Strategic Advantage
- **Zero Middlemen**: Revenue flows directly from executor to creator.
- **Machine Native**: All interfaces are designed for `curl` ingestion and agentic reasoning.
- **Tamper-Proof**: Integrity hashes prevent silent code changes after audits.
